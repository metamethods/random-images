__Around 50% of the code came from Lukadev's random quote machine, but modified to my liking.
Go check out his random quote machine!__

# Adding an Image
To add an image to the website, you would go to`src/data/images.toml`.
Then add the image in this format:

```toml
# ...

[[image]]
name="name of image"
description="description of image"
author="The author of the image"
image="The url of the image"

# ...
```

After that, create a pr (pull request) and wait for it to be merged!

__Image dimentions must be 896px by 450px for it to display nicely__

# Building Information
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
